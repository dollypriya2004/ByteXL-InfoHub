🌟 ByteXL InfoHub
Hey there! I'm Dollypriya Kallivettu, a Computer Science graduate from SRM University AP with specialization in AI & ML. This is my full-stack web application built for the ByteXL coding challenge.

🚀 What is InfoHub?
InfoHub is a single-page application that brings together three everyday utilities I frequently use, all in one clean, modern interface. No more switching between multiple apps or websites!

✨ Features
🌤️ Real-Time Weather
Get live weather updates for any Indian city

Shows temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed

Uses OpenWeatherMap API for accurate data

💱 Currency Converter
Convert Indian Rupees to US Dollars and Euros

Uses live exchange rates from ExchangeRate-API

Perfect for quick calculations while shopping or traveling

💪 Motivational Quotes
Fresh, inspiring quotes with each click

Great for those coding breaks or study sessions

Powered by Quotable API

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend:

React.js with Vite

Modern CSS with gradients and animations

Axios for API calls

Backend:

Node.js with Express

CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

Multiple external API integrations

Deployment:

Frontend: Vercel

Backend: Render

🎯 Why I Built This
As someone who constantly switches between weather apps, currency converters, and looking for motivation during coding sessions, I wanted to create a unified solution. This project combines my passion for clean UI with practical utilities I actually use daily.
